# Carbometer 
###### Version 1.0.0
This is our CS102 project.

Carbometer is a desktop application that calculates the total damage that users do to nature and encourages them to donate as much as the damage they have caused to nature. Carbometer makes the users' damage level more understandable, with a special unit called Carbopoint. With its intuitive interface thanks to Carbobar, Carbometer provides users with a simple to use yet effective experience.

## Features

### Carbopoint

Carbopoint is a collective unit that is formed based on the questions users have answered in many different areas. Users can compare their Carbopoint values with their old Carbopoint, other users and world averages.
As the world average, the Carbopoint is fixed at 48 (THIS IS NOT JUST AN AVERAGE OUT OF 100).

### Carbobar

Carbobar created for the users to understand their Carbopoint levels more easily. It is visible in many panels. Unlike Carbopoint, Carbobar provides a representation over 100 max value. Carbobar stops updating when a user's damage level exceeds the approximate average value of 50 Carbopoints.
